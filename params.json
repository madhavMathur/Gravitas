{"name":"Gravitas","tagline":"Particle Gravity Simulator","body":"***\r\n## What is Gravitas?\r\nGravitas is an interactive desktop application which allows users to simulate the effects of gravity on a closed system of particles. The application is capable of handling up to 2000 particles, and can simulate ordinary solar systems, binary star systems and planet-moon systems. \r\n\r\n## Why should you care?\r\nIn approximately 2 billion years, Andromeda, our galactic neighbour, will collide with the Milky Way Galaxy. To predict the effects of such a collision, several researches are now studying closed particle gravity simulators to simulate similar scenarios on a much smaller scale. Gravitas is built for that very purpose: to help researchers study galactic collisions. By studying a closed system of particles interacting through gravity, scientists can make significant conclusions about galactic collisions and solve great questions in a astronomy.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility and Technical Details\r\nGravitas runs on the Java Swing platform, and is capable of running on almost every popular operating system like Windows, Mac OS and Linux, which have Java installed. Gravitas requires at least Java 5 to run correctly. The program relies heavily on multi-threading to be able to handle the tremendous load of concurrency computations, and therefore perform significantly better on multi-core processor systems as compared to single core processor systems. Hyper threading enabled CPUs such as the Intel i7 5770K also perform brilliantly. \r\n\r\n## Future Additions\r\nI am currently working on adding more extreme objects such as black holes and pulsars for the next beta version v2.0. I'm also working on making the simulator more realistic, by incorporating physics laws like the conservation of angular momentum and Einstein's Theory of Gravitation. The v2.0 beta is set to be released in December 2015.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nMadhav Mathur (@madhavMathur), built Gravitas in late 2014 -- early 2015. Inspired by the late Dr. Carl Sagan's book 'Pale Blue Dot', this is his first major project related to astronomy and scientific programming.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
